FIX FOR BOOKING ERROR:

The error "Multiple classes found for path 'Guest'" happens because we're importing Guest inside the booking callback.

SOLUTION:
1. Add these imports at the top of app.py (line 1-6):
   import streamlit as st
   import uuid
   from datetime import date, timedelta
   from system import HotelSystem
   from agent import HospitalityAIAgent
   from models import RoomType, Guest
   from sqlmodel import select

2. Then in the booking button code (around line 289-292), REMOVE these lines:
   from sqlmodel import Session, select
   from models import Guest
   import uuid

3. Keep only:
   from sqlmodel import Session

This prevents duplicate Guest class registration.
